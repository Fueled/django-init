## Getting Started

Install cookiecutter with `brew install cookiecutter` or `pip install cookiecutter`.

```
cookiecutter gh:Fueled/django-init
```

It will ask you couple of questions required to generate the project. It will generate a folder containing all the files in your current working directory.

If you opt to setup the project automatically, it will also:
- initialize a git repo and bump initial tag and version.
- create a virtualenv in the folder `venv` inside the project.
- install all the python dependencies inside it.
- try to create a postgres database and run the initial migration against it.

then only thing you'll need to do is:

1. `cd` into the new `github_repository` folder just created.
2. Activate virtualenv `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Run `fab serve` or `./manage.py runserver`

Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

You can also explore the [wiki] section for details on advance setup and usages.
