## Getting up and running

Minimum requirements: **pip, python3.9, poetry, redis & [PostgreSQL 11][install-postgres]{% if cookiecutter.add_postgis.lower() == "y" %} with postgis-2.4{% endif %}**, setup is tested on Mac OSX only.

```
brew install python3 poetry libmagic postgres {% if cookiecutter.add_postgis == 'y' %}postgis{% endif %}
```

In your terminal, type or copy-paste the following:

    git clone git@github.com:{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.github_repository }}.git; cd {{ cookiecutter.github_repository }}; make install

Go grab a cup of coffee, we bake your hot development machine.

Useful commands:

- `make run` - start [django server](http://localhost:8000/)
- `make deploy_docs` - deploy docs to server
- `make test` - run the test locally with ipdb

**NOTE:** Checkout `Makefile` for all the options available and how they do it.

## Managing dependencies

### Poetry

To guarantee repeatable installations, all project dependencies are managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). The projectâ€™s direct dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
Running `poetry lock` generates `poetry.lock` which has all versions pinned.

You can install Poetry by using `pip install --pre poetry` or by following the official installation guide [here](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).

*Tip:* We recommend that you use this workflow and keep `pyproject.toml` as well as `poetry.lock` under version control to make sure all computers and environments run exactly the same code.

### Other tools

For compatibility, `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` can be updated by running

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
```

and

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements_dev.txt --dev
```

, respectively.


## Deploying Project

The deployment are managed via travis, but for the first time you'll need to set the configuration values on each of the server.

Check out detailed server setup instruction [here](docs/backend/server_config.md).
